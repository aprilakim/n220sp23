My plan is to use p5 to draw a cat. I will use variables to craete the radius 
so that the eyes are easier to create. I will also use a variable to set the 
lenth of the ears.These changes will ensure things stay proportionate even with editing.
I will use an oval face, a circle within a circle for each eye. Weighted strokes for the 
whiskers. Traingle for the ears.
