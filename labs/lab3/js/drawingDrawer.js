//Create design/shape and block it into a (draw) function
//Set variables for x and y so that they can be incremented/ move around (in a for loop?)
//Set variables for mouseX & mouseY similar to above step so mouse movement can be tracked and updated
//Call draw function 3 different times with different x & y values so that 3 images appear simultaneously
